This code solves the time independent Schroedinger equation in 2D with a constant mass.

It uses 2 different algorithms that can be switched ON/OFF:

-> The FDM: Finite Difference Method

-> The PWE: Plane Wave Expansion method that solves the equation in the Fourier space

Three different potentials are proposed:

-> The Rectangular potential

-> The Elliptical potential

-> The Hexagonal potential

Any potential can be loaded with homogeneous grid x,y [m] and V [eV]
